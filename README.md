## BANE
- DESC. : Mini game made with jQuery. Roguelike. "Lost in dark caves you have to stay alive"
- PROGRESS : 10%

## UNITY
### Unity Course

_I'm taking a class to learn gamedev. The class is : [Learn to Code by Making Games - Complete C# Unity Developer](https://www.udemy.com/unitycourse/) on Udemy. With this course you will learn how to code in C# using Unity by making 7 2D-3D games. I recommand it :)_

Here are the games I've made along this course (more coming soon). They are commented, free to use. However I only ask you to credit for the 2D pixel art graphics, I've made them all :) (All but the fonts, of-course).

#### Text101          
- **DESC** : First game made with Udemy courses. It's basically a text adventure with really basic choices.
- **DEV PROGRESS** : 100%
#### Number Wizard UI
- **DESC** : Second game. It's a game where the computer will dare you to choose a number he won't guess between 1 and 1000. Very simple to make. Graphics of mine.
- **DEV PROGRESS** : 100%
#### Block Breaker
- **DESC** : Third game. Here we go ! We're comming to some more interesting games :). It's an old school block breaker. *(All off the 2D sprites are homemade, like for Number Wizard UI. Please credit me if you use them.)*
- **DEV PROGRESS** : 100%
- **EXTRA FEATURES** : *I haved added some extra features to the game which were not on the course* :
	- *Lives* : The player got 6 lives for each level.
	- *PowerUps* : one increase the paddle size, the other will decrease it.
	- *Credit Page* : I wanted to credit some of the software and artist I used along this game's developpement.
	- *"Suicide" key* : If the ball get stuck (see "KNOWN BUGS" bellow) it allow the player to get new ball by losing a life, destroying the actual one and instantiating a new one. The key is "R".
 - **KNOWN BUGS** : 
 	- For some mysterious reasons, the ball may be stuck on walls or roof without being able to do anything else than going along back and forth the obstacle.
 - **SUGGESTIONS FOR THE FUTURE** :
 	- Adding more PowerUps. Like using the "auto play" mode for few seconds
	- Adding more levels
	- Adding a level editor with some easy way to share your own level
	- Differents paddles with theirs own special abilities
	- Moving bricks !
	- Multiballs
	- Temporary lazers firing paddle powerup
